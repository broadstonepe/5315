      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a distributed version control system, meaning your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the copy on the server. A Version Control System is important to have because it allows you to have "versions" of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows you to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes. A Version Control System also allows multiple developers to make changes and each change can be attributed to a specific developer.</p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>1) Local repo is short for local repository. A repository is a data structure that is used by Git to store information. Commit objects and references to commit objects, called heads, are examples of things contained within a repository. A local repository is a repository that resides within the developer's machine.</p>

      <p>2) Remote repo is short for remote repository. A remote repository is a Git repository hosted on the Internet or some other network. Cloning a remote repository creates a local version of that repository on your machine, giving you the ability to experiment without affecting the original codebase. Cloning also establishes a connection between the local repository on your machine and the remote repository, allowing push and pull actions with the remote project. Multiple clones of a single remote can be created by other team members, enabling others to collaborate on the same project efficiently and with less risk to the original code.</p>

      <p>3) A team leader is the owner of the repository and he/she can add collaborators. The collaborators will receive an exact copy of the team leader's repository and they can clone the repository to their local drive. With the repository cloned on their local drives, the collaborators are able to work on and make changes to the project. This allows allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time.</p>
